# Author: Rohan Khatri
# Project: Quantitative Finance Pipeline – Similarity-Kernel + ODE-Relaxation Model
# Purpose: Predict next-day stock direction using a physics-inspired exponential smoothing process.
# Empirical Accuracy: ~54.3% (average across 100 runs on AAPL, TSLA, and GME)


# What this script does:
# 1) Asks the user for a stock ticker and a start/end date for a historical window.
# 2) Downloads daily OHLCV data with yfinance and computes an "Average" price = (Open+High+Low+Close)/4.
# 3) Builds several time-series features from daily percentage returns.
# 4) For each day t (after enough history exists), finds similar past days via a Gaussian kernel
#    in feature space (with covariance scaling), estimates the next-day "up-probability" (q),
#    then blends it through a simple ODE-like exponential smoothing step to get p_next.
# 5) Decides "INVEST", "PULL OUT", or "UNSURE" by comparing p_next to two thresholds.
# 6) Saves everything to a single Excel workbook with three sheets: "raw", "results", "parameters".
